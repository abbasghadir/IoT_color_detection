This project involves the design of an IoT board based on the ESP32-S microcontroller to detect specific color ranges through a camera module. The detected color data is processed and sent to a remote server using the HTTP POST method in a JSON format.

Requirements:
•	Hardware:
o	ESP32-s (or ESP32CAM)
o	OV2640 camera
o	FFC 24 pin connector and cable (right cable and bottom connector)
o	5V to 3.3V AMS117 regulator
o	4-pin phoenix connector
o	Micro USB SMD 4-pin-holder
o	Relay 5V
o	Buzzer 5V
o	IPUS PSRAM
o	CH340G
o	12.000MHZ oscillator
o	TAC switch.

•	Software:
o	VScode, platform IO extension.
o	Arduino IDE
o	Python (or PHP)
o	XAMPP (or APACHE and MYSQL)
